## Problem
What user problem or business need does this address?

## User
Who is the primary user? What's their role, context, and skill level?

## Current Workflow
How does the user accomplish this today? What's painful?

## Proposed Change
What specifically changes for the user? Walk through the new flow step by step.

## Scope
### In Scope
- What we're building this iteration

### Out of Scope
- What we're explicitly not building yet

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]

## Edge Cases & Error States
- What happens when things go wrong?
- What are the boundary conditions?`,

## Vision
One paragraph: what is this app, who is it for, and why does it need to exist?

## Target User
- Who are they? (role, demographics, technical skill)
- What's their current workflow without this app?
- What's the primary pain point?

## Core User Flows
1. **[Flow Name]**: User does X, sees Y, achieves Z
2. **[Flow Name]**: User does X, sees Y, achieves Z
3. **[Flow Name]**: User does X, sees Y, achieves Z

## Feature Requirements
### Must Have (MVP)
- Feature with clear description

### Nice to Have (V2)
- Feature with clear description

## Data Model
Key entities and their relationships:
- **User**: fields, relationships
- **[Entity]**: fields, relationships

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Framework, styling
- **Backend**: Language, framework, database
- **Auth**: Strategy (email/password, OAuth, magic link)
- **Hosting**: Where it runs

## API Design
Key endpoints the backend needs:
- GET /api/... — description
- POST /api/... — description

## UI/UX
- Visual style and layout
- Key pages/screens
- Mobile requirements

## Authentication & Authorization
- Sign-up flow
- Roles and permissions

## Deployment & Infrastructure
- Environment variables
- Build and run commands
- Database setup`,

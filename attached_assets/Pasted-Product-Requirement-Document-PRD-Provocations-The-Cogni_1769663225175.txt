Product Requirement Document (PRD): "Provocations" – The Cognitive Musculature Tool
Project Goal: To transition from AI as an "assistant" (outsourced reason) to AI as a "tool for thought" that challenges the user, enhances critical thinking, and protects human agency.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Problem Statement
Current AI assistants create an "outsourced reason" workflow where knowledge workers become "professional validators of a robot’s opinions". This leads to a hive mind effect (boring, repetitive ideas), reduced critical thinking, and diminished memory of the work produced.
2. Target User
Knowledge workers (Clara-type personas) who need to analyze complex data, industry reports, or meeting transcripts to produce original, high-stakes proposals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. User Flow & Functional Requirements
Phase 1: Initial Input ("Paste Text" Form)
• Requirement: The entry point is a clean "Paste Text" form where the user provides the raw materials of their craft.
• Input Types: Meeting transcripts, internal reports, industry documents, or raw notes.
• Objective: To load the workspace with source documents that serve as the foundation for "material engagement".
Phase 2: Source Analysis (Lenses)
• Requirement: The system shall generate "Lenses"—customizable micro-representations of the pasted text.
• Features:
    ◦ Users can select specific lenses (e.g., "Consumer’s Lens") to emphasize information relevant to their current task.
    ◦ Section-by-section summaries that are task-specific rather than generic.
Phase 3: Deep Reading & "Provocations"
• Requirement: As the user reads the source, the system provides "Provocations"—AI-generated commentary and critiques.
• Types of Provocations:
    ◦ Opportunities: Highlighting potential areas for business growth or innovation.
    ◦ Fallacies/Counterarguments: Identifying logical gaps in the user’s thinking or the source text.
    ◦ Alternatives: Suggesting lateral moves or different perspectives.
• User Action: Provocations are strategic prompts; the user must intentionally decide whether to address, highlight, or ignore them.
Phase 4: Manual Outline Construction
• Requirement: A side pane for a manually built outline.
• Feature: The user sketches the flow of the argument at a high level. While AI can help generate a paragraph from a heading, the structure remains rooted in the user’s "cognitively effortful" judgments.
Phase 5: Refinement (Dimensions)
• Requirement: Tools for rapid testing of text versions.
• Features:
    ◦ Resizing Paragraphs: Ability to drag/resize a paragraph to change its length dynamically.
    ◦ Dimension Toggling: Selecting customizable tones (e.g., "Inspirational" vs. "Practical") to preview alternatives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Design Principles (The "Non-Negotiables")
• No Chat Box: The interface must avoid a chat-centric design. Assistance should be "silent and appropriate," acting as a computer tool rather than an "ersatz human".
• Productive Resistance: The tool must not always be "right" or "helpful" in the traditional sense; it is successful if it forces the user to make a confident decision to reject a suggestion.
• Preservation of Material Engagement: The software must ensure the user remains the primary author by requiring them to read relevant portions and construct the argument themselves.
5. Success Metrics
• Metacognitive Engagement: Evidence that the user is actively critiquing and iterating on their own thinking process.
• Memory Retention: Users should demonstrate a higher recall of the final document compared to standard AI-drafted reports.
• Idea Diversity: A wider range of creative outputs compared to generic AI-assisted hive-mind workflows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Closing Vision: This tool asks the user: "Would you rather have a tool that thinks for you, or a tool that makes you think?"
